    <h3>I love zucchini, and it's always fun to find new ways to use it. I added my favorite zucchini
    bread ingredients, cinnamon and vanilla, to a fluffy pancake recipe! If you like nuts in your quick
    breads, you may try adding 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts or pecans to your batter.</h3>
    <h2> <strong> <u>Ingredients</u> </strong> </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded zucchini</li>

    </ul>
    <h2> <strong> <u>Instructions/Steps</u> </strong> </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add lemon juice to a cup of milk. Set aside until milk starts to curdle, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, sugar, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Make a
        well in the center. Pour in curdled milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract. Stir with a
        spoon or whisk until the batter is just combined. Add shredded zucchini and mix until well
        incorporated.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and coat with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 cupfuls of batter
        onto the skillet, and cook until bubbles appear on the surface, about 2 minutes. Flip with a
        spatula, and cook until browned, about 2 more minutes.</li>
